Once upon a time...
On a misty morning, Maya found a tiny, glowing stone by the riverbank. Curious, she picked it up, and suddenly, the world around her shimmered with colors she had never seen. The stone whispered, "Make a wish." Without hesitation, she wished for a friend. Moments later, a cheerful fox appeared, wagging its tail, ready to explore the world with her.
